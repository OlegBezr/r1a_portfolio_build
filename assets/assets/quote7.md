> According to Cheibub et al. "Democracy and dictatorship revisited" (2010), military dictatorship is a dictatorship in which the military exerts complete or substantial control over political authority, and the dictator is often a high-ranked military officer. Though we donâ€™t know exactly who commands the military force in Sleep Dealer, the military in the movie has control over political authority as it claims the sovereignty of Mexico, by enforcing laws for Mexican people, and gets promoted on social media through the Drones show.
