>In the first five minutes of the film, when Memo and his father approach a water reservoir to get some water for the farm, they are confronted by a military turret, which holds them at gunpoint until they confirm its directions. In the next scene, we can see a turret looking directly into the camera, making the viewers feel as if they are also being held at a gunpoint (Sleep Dealer, 4:08â€“4:52). The viewer is put in the same position as humiliated Mexican people, which better communicates the constant threat civilians face in Sleep Dealer.
