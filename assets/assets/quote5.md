>Ramirez precisely follows the orders but freezes as he sees a civilian man (Memo’s father) crawling out of the house; it takes him a few seconds to get himself together and eliminate the man by following his commander’s order (Sleep Dealer, 14:50–16:49). Despite the fact that Ramirez completes his objectives, he has doubts: the dead man looked like a civilian, not a terrorist, thus Ramirez questions whether he did the right thing by killing him and demolishing his home.
