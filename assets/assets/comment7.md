I included this excerpt in my portfolio as it's the only R1A writing I have where I introduce a scientific term to make my paper more clear. At first, I didn't have any explanation of the term **military dictatorship** but I was adviced to add one by Christian. After the edits I have shown both versions to my suitmates and was quite suprised that they indeed liked the version with explanation more - it made my paper clearer and more engaging.
