The excerpt above presents a topic sentence from my first essay. I decided to include it in my collection because it shows where I started so that it's easier to understand my progress as well as to reflect on it from my current perspective. This topic sentence is a mere observation, it focuses on the small details of the story rather then their contribution to the ideas addressed in the literary work. Since then I have greatly improved my topic sentences and they now resemble claims more than observations.
