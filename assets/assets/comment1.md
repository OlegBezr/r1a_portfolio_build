My first introduction only explained the structure of the essay. It didn't mention any of the claims and ideas from the paper, which ultimately made the introduction lose one of its main goals: *outline main points*. The claims in the second introduction made the idea of the paper more clear and the reading more pleasing. I also really like how I changed immature *"This paper analyses"* to more professional *"To prove its central claim, the paper examines"*.
