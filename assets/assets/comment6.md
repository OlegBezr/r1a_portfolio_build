This is the title of my last essay. I'm really proud of how it presents my essay: it's short, catchy, and still relevant to my main idea. My work on this title improved my understanding of the essay overall and helped me to make it stronger by changing the claims. At first I was thinking that my essay is focusing on the picture of military in the film but as I was working on the title and reviewing my ideas, I understood that I'm writing about how *the military plays the central role in the film* - this idea ended up being a perfect ending claim in my conclusion.
