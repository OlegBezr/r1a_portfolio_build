My first introduction: 

> This paper analyses several reactions of the newspaper story readers from the literary work and proves them all to show the same superiority over Little Flower. It gives a general overlook of the reactions of the readers, then focuses on the reaction of the mother, who spent her childhood in an orphanage, and on to the reaction of a family, which is trying to estimate Little Flowerâ€™s size with a ruler.

Last introduction:

>To prove its central claim, the paper examines how the images of war machines in the movie create a persistent atmosphere of horror, suppressing resistance by Mexican people and creating a strong tension for the viewers; and, it analyses how the inhuman and boundless actions of the military turn Ramirez, a recruit of the US army, against the ruthless military power.
