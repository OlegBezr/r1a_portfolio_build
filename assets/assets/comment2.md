The first topic sentence only presents an observation and doesn't analyze it to make a claim. I'm really proud of the second topic sentence and especially of the idea of *inner collapse* as it took me many tries and several hours to come up with this topic sentence. At first, the second topic sentence claimed that *"military operations made Ramirez betray it"*, which is more of an observation in the context of *Sleep Dealer*.
