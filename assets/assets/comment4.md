In the past, I have never worked on a deep analysis of the film. I have written several film reviems for the school classes but they were quite different from our work. I decided to include this excerpt because it analyses a very short yet important moment of the film; focusing on the small details of camera movement and scene was something new and very exciting to me. I also really like my claim related to this small scene as it reflects the feelings I had while watching *Sleep Dealer*.
